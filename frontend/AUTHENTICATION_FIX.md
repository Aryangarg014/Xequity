# Authentication Persistence Fix


## Problem
Users were getting logged out automatically after refreshing the page, regardless of which page they were on.


## Solution
Implemented persistent authentication using localStorage with the following features:


### Changes Made


1. **Authentication Utilities** (`src/utils.js`):
   - Added `saveAuthData()` - Saves user data and timestamp to localStorage
   - Added `clearAuthData()` - Removes all authentication data from localStorage
   - Added `getAuthData()` - Retrieves and validates authentication data
   - Added 24-hour expiration for security


2. **App Component** (`src/App.jsx`):
   - Added `useEffect` to check for existing authentication on component mount
   - Added loading state to prevent flashing during authentication check
   - Created `handleLogin()` and `handleLogout()` functions
   - Updated Login component to use new authentication handler


3. **Login Component** (`src/Login/Login.jsx`):
   - Updated to pass userData to the new authentication handler
   - Maintains existing functionality while adding persistence


4. **Headbar Component** (`src/Headbar.jsx`):
   - Updated logout handler to use the new authentication system
   - Maintains existing UI/UX


### Features


- **Persistent Login**: Users stay logged in after page refresh
- **Automatic Expiration**: Authentication expires after 24 hours for security
- **Loading State**: Prevents UI flashing during authentication check
- **Secure Storage**: Uses localStorage with timestamp validation
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality remains unchanged


### How It Works


1. When user logs in, authentication data is saved to localStorage
2. On page refresh/load, the app checks localStorage for existing authentication
3. If valid authentication exists, user remains logged in
4. If authentication is expired or invalid, user is logged out automatically
5. Logout clears all authentication data from localStorage


### Security Considerations


- Authentication expires after 24 hours
- All authentication data is cleared on logout
- Timestamp validation prevents stale authentication
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage (only user info needed for UI)


## Testing


To test the fix:
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to any page
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. You should remain logged in and on the same page
5. Try refreshing multiple times to ensure persistence
6. Wait 24 hours or manually clear localStorage to test expiration
